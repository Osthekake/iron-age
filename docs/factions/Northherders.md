## History
The Northherders are descendants of the first people who settled in the North - the Old Men who were driven northward by the expanding Aryn Civilization. They adapted to the harsh mountain environment through nomadic herding and fishing, developing a shamanistic religion centered on blood sacrifice and dark spiritual journeys. Their constant movement makes them difficult targets for Mar raids, though it limits their ability to build lasting settlements. They maintain their traditional ways stubbornly, viewing the settled cultures as having lost touch with the spiritual realities of the world. Their religious practices often put them at odds with the more organized Westmen faiths, though they trade pragmatically with Ironburners for metal tools they cannot produce themselves.
