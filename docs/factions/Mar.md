"Take what you need."

Giants and Hobgoblins who invaded from the east, now living as pirates and bandits in old Aryn and Rhuul forts. They attack everyone opportunistically using an ancient messaging system for coordination, while avoiding Paer forests and constantly trying to crush Hiren fortresses.

## History
The Mar invaded from the east in waves of giants and hobgoblins, overwhelming the eastern portions of Merona before their advance was slowed by fortified positions and difficult terrain. They captured ancient Aryn and Rhuul forts, establishing these as bases for their raiding operations. Their greatest strength is an ancient messaging system that allows unprecedented coordination between scattered bands, making their raids highly effective. However, they learned to fear the Paer forests after devastating losses to ambush tactics, and despite constant attempts, they have never managed to breach Hiren fortresses. They live by taking what others have, viewing the settled cultures as little more than resources to be exploited. Their inability to take Hiren fortresses represents both their greatest frustration and the primary limitation on their expansion.
