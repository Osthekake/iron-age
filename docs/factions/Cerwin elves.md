## History
The Cerwin are descendants of the ancient Aryn Civilization, once masters of the continent. After the fall of their great empire, these elves held onto their stone cities and advanced knowledge, becoming isolated remnants of a glorious past. They maintain their ancestral traditions of stone architecture and wooden mechanics, viewing other cultures as lesser beings struggling in a world without proper governance. Their professional soldiers and fortified cities have allowed them to survive the Mar invasion largely intact, though they remain constantly at risk of being overwhelmed. They continue to trade using their old capital and connections, adapting ancient economic systems to a world that has largely moved beyond such structures.
