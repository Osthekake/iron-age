## History
The Aryn Civilization was the dominant elven empire that ruled western and central [[Merona]] for millennia before its sudden and mysterious collapse. They achieved remarkable technological advancement, creating stone cities powered by complex mechanisms, automated systems, and crystal energy sources. Their civilization built extensive road networks, developed sophisticated metallurgy, and created architectural marvels that modern cultures still struggle to replicate. The reasons for their fall remain unknown - some theories speak of internal rebellion, others of external catastrophe, and some of gradual decline. Their ruins dot the landscape across their former territory, with modern [[Cerwin elves]] being their direct descendants who struggle to maintain their ancestors' knowledge. Modern cultures across [[Merona]] benefit from their legacy through both excavated artifacts and the infrastructure foundations they left behind.
