## History
The Westmen formed as a monastic order dedicated to preserving knowledge and protecting coastal populations along the ancient Aryn sea routes. Comprising elves, halflings, and humans united by their devotion to Seringor and the sea, they established fortified strongholds at strategic locations. Their philosophy emphasizes defense over offense, education over conquest, and protection over aggression. They maintain ancient knowledge of navigation, weather patterns, and coastal survival, teaching these skills to local populations. When Mar raiders attack, the Westmen withdraw to their fortified positions, weathering the storms of invasion rather than risking open battle. This defensive strategy, combined with their commitment to educating and protecting local communities, has made them trusted guardians throughout the coastal regions.
