## History
The Wagoners were ancient gnomish civilization that flourished in southeastern [[Merona]], renowned for their extraordinary engineering and transportation expertise. While other cultures struggled with natural obstacles, the Wagoners simply cut straight roads through hills, valleys, and forests, creating an unparalleled transportation network. Their advanced knowledge of mathematics, surveying, and mechanics allowed them to build sophisticated wheeled vehicles and infrastructure that connected distant communities. Their civilization enabled unprecedented levels of trade, cultural exchange, and communication across southeastern [[Merona]]. Though their empire eventually collapsed, their roads remain as enduring monuments to their engineering genius and continue to serve as vital trade arteries in modern times. Modern [[Hiren]] are thought to be their descendants, maintaining some of their engineering knowledge and mechanical expertise.
