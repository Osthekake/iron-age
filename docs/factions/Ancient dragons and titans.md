## Motto
"Before memory began."

Beings of immense power who shaped the world in primordial times, their works still visible in the landscape and remembered through fossilized remains and geological scars.

## Artifacts
- **Dragon Skeletons**: Massive fossilized remains found buried deep within mountain ranges and desert badlands
- **Titan Bones**: Enormous skeletal structures that serve as natural landmarks and geological formations
- **Great Scars**: Massive geological formations created by their battles or earth-shaping activities
- **Heart Stones**: Crystallized remnants of their life force, radiating faint magical energy
- **Scale Fossils**: Petrified dragon scales embedded in rock formations, showing their immense size

## Impact
- **Landscape Formation**: The entire geography of Merona bears the marks of their existence - mountains raised by their movements, valleys carved by their passing, and plains flattened by their battles
- **Geological Stability**: Their buried remains contribute to the stability and magical properties of certain regions
- **Magical Resonance**: Areas where they lived or died still echo with their power, affecting current magic and wildlife
- **Resource Creation**: Their decomposition and fossilization created unique materials that modern cultures mine and use
- **Cultural Memory**: Their existence forms the foundation of creation myths and legends across all modern cultures

## History
The Ancient Dragons and Titans existed in the primordial world before the rise of mortal civilizations. They were beings of such immense power that their very movements shaped continents and their battles created geological features that persist to this day. When they died, their bodies fossilized into materials of great magical and practical value. Modern cultures across Merona incorporate them into their creation myths, with some believing the dragons created the world while others think they destroyed an earlier civilization. Their remains serve as both valuable resources and sacred sites, with some cultures guarding their fossil beds while others mine them for materials. The scale of their existence is nearly impossible for modern beings to comprehend, suggesting they operated on a level of reality far beyond current understanding.
