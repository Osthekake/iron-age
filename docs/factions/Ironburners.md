## History
The Ironburners are descendants of the [[The Barrow Men]] who adapted to the harsh mountain environments by mastering iron production and charcoal making. When the Mar invaded, their scattered camps and small towns proved difficult to conquer, but also left them vulnerable to constant raiding. They developed a pragmatic survival strategy focused on economic productivity and strategic alliances. Their secret ancestor worship provides spiritual strength and connection to ancient knowledge. Unable to field effective armies against [[Mar]] giants, they rely on mobility, [[Westmen]] protection, and their economic importance to survive. Their control over fuel and metal production makes them valuable allies to more powerful cultures.
