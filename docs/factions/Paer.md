## History
The Paer are ancient halfling inhabitants of the deep woods who developed a symbiotic relationship with their forest home over countless generations. They learned to build their communities within hillsides and under tree roots, creating burrow towns that blend seamlessly with the forest. Their intimate knowledge of every trail, clearing, and hiding place makes their territory virtually impassable to outsiders, especially Mar raiders who quickly learn that entering Paer forests means certain death. They harvest wood sustainably, trading small quantities to outsiders while maintaining the forest's health and their own secrecy. Their protection comes not from walls or armies, but from the forest itself and their mastery of ambush tactics.
