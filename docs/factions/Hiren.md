## History
The Hiren are descendants of the ancient Rhuul who survived the cataclysmic flood that destroyed their original forges. They rebuilt in the central mountains, combining dwarven resilience and gnomish ingenuity to create impregnable fortresses connected by underground trade routes. Their mastery of metalworking produces the finest steel in the land, which they trade strategically while protecting their most advanced techniques. Their stone cities have withstood countless Mar assaults, making them the only culture truly secure from the invasion. They maintain careful neutrality in most conflicts, focusing on their technological advancement and defensive strength. Their underground networks allow them to continue trade even when surface routes are threatened, ensuring their survival and prosperity regardless of the chaos above.
