## Motto
"Before the elves came north."

The first human settlers in the northern regions, driven northward by the expanding [Aryn Civilization](Aryn%20Civilization.md), leaving behind burial mounds and standing stones that mark their presence.

## Artifacts
- **Barrow Mounds**: Ancient burial chambers filled with grave goods and ceremonial objects
- **Standing Stones**: Megalithic arrangements used for astronomical observation and religious rituals
- **Bronze Tools**: Weapons, implements, and decorative objects showing sophisticated metalworking
- **Ceramic Vessels**: Storage containers with distinct patterns and manufacturing techniques
- **Amber Jewelry**: Decorative items made from imported amber, showing trade networks

## Impact
- **Cultural Foundation**: Their ancestral practices and beliefs influenced later Northherder shamanism and burial customs
- **Settlement Patterns**: Their preferred settlement locations became traditional sites for later northern communities
- **Metallurgical Knowledge**: Bronze working techniques spread to northern cultures and evolved independently
- **Spiritual Legacy**: Their burial practices and stone arrangements formed basis of Northherder religious sites
- **Territorial Memory**: Place names and geographical knowledge passed down through their occupation of northern lands

## History
The Old Men were the first human settlers to arrive in northern [Merona](../locations/Merona.md), establishing communities thousands of years before the Aryan Civilization expanded northward. They developed sophisticated bronze working, built megalithic structures for astronomical and religious purposes, and created extensive trade networks stretching as far as the southern coasts. When the Aryn expanded into their territories, they were gradually driven northward into the harsh mountain environments, where they adapted to the challenging conditions. Their legacy survives in the burial mounds, standing stones, and bronze artifacts that dot the northern landscape. Modern [Northherders](Northherders.md) are their direct descendants, maintaining elements of their ancestral culture through shamanistic practices that echo Old Men spiritual traditions. Their displacement represents one of the earliest known conflicts between expanding civilizations in [Merona](../locations/Merona.md)'s history.
