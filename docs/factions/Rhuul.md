## History
The Rhuul were ancient dwarven civilization that established their domain in the central mountains of [Merona](../locations/Merona.md), becoming masters of metallurgy and forging for the Aryan Civilization. They developed sophisticated underground forge complexes and created weapons of superior quality that made them indispensable to their elven allies. Their control of mountain passes and strategic resources gave them significant influence and wealth. The Rhuul civilization came to sudden end when a cataclysmic flood or tidal wave destroyed their primary settlements and forges, drowning their greatest works and ending their dominance. Modern [Hiren](Hiren.md) are their descendants, maintaining the dwarven tradition of metalworking excellence and guarding the secrets of their ancestors' forging techniques. The ruins of their great forges still exist in the mountains, sometimes explored by modern cultures seeking to rediscover their lost metallurgical knowledge. Their destruction represents one of the most dramatic civilization-ending events in [Merona](../locations/Merona.md)'s history.
