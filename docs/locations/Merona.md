The continent of the world of Hemos where the story takes place.

An iron age world with a power vacuum in the wake of a collapsing Elven Empire, and an invading, monstrous army from the east.
## Regions

### [Aegon Wastes](Aegon%20Wastes.md)
The southern desert, where ghosts of ancient seafarers dwell in ancient stone structures. Marks the southern extent of [Merona](Merona.md).
### [Mosswater](Mosswater.md)
The central ocean, a large inland lake separated from [Frostmere](regions/Frostmere.md) by the [Ironcrest Range](regions/Ironcrest Range.md), connected to the [Elven Reach](regions/Elven Reach.md) via a series of lakes and rivers. Teal or green in color.
### [Whisperwood](Whisperwood.md)
The dark forests at the eastern shores of Mosswater, where the wood-dwelling halfling Paer thrive in deep woods.
### [Ironfen](Ironfen.md)
The wetlands around the north edges of [Mosswater](regions/Mosswater.md), where ironburners burn peat for iron production and practice charcoal-making from the abundant trees.
### [Spine Peaks](Spine%20Peaks.md)
The central mountains, between [Mosswater](regions/Mosswater.md) and the [Elven Reach](regions/Elven Reach.md), with deep valleys cut through them.
### [Elvenshade](Elvenshade.md)
The lush elven heartlands east of the Spine Peaks, bordering the Elven Reach, Mosswater, Ironcrest Range, and Frostmere.
### [Frostmere](Frostmere.md)
The icy sea, the North-western boundary of [Merona](Merona.md). Along the coast, there are many rocky islands, some of which have small towns or monasteries on them. The sea is bountiful in fish, but treacherous in weather.
### [Ironcrest Range](Ironcrest%20Range.md)
The north mountains, a long chain that separate [Mosswater](regions/Mosswater.md) from [Frostmere](regions/Frostmere.md). Rich in rainfall, and maybe in iron. Rocky cliffs face [Frostmere](regions/Frostmere.md), and vast stretches of bogs and moors face [Mosswater](regions/Mosswater.md). Some places there are glaciers, which contribute to the color of [Mosswater](regions/Mosswater.md).
### [Elven Reach](Elven%20Reach.md)
The south sea, a salty ocean which the Elven Empire was built around. Connected to [Frostmere](regions/Frostmere.md) through a narrow strait, with treacherous currents.
### [Windblown Wastes](Windblown%20Wastes.md)
The eastern plains, grassy plains in wide valleys without a single tree.
