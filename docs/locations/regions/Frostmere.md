## Short Description
The north-western boundary of [[Merona]], a treacherous sea with rocky islands, bountiful fish, and dangerous weather.

## Cultures
- **[[Westmen]] Sea Monks**: Religious orders who follow the old sea routes and protect coastal populations
- **Seasonal Fishers**: [[Northherders]] who come to the coast during certain seasons to fish

## Cities and Sites
- **[[Westwatch]](../../sites/Westwatch.md)**: Largest Westmen monastery serving as center for trade, education, and coastal protection
- **The Monastery of Tides**: [[Westmen]] religious community that maintains ancient knowledge of sea patterns and navigation
- **Rocky Harbor**: Natural anchorage that provides shelter from worst storms, though still dangerous
- **The Frozen Isles**: Northernmost islands where ice meets sea, creating unique and hazardous conditions

## Climate
Cold and harsh year-round, with frequent storms that can appear suddenly. Winter brings ice that can enclose smaller islands, while summer offers only brief respite with slightly calmer seas. The weather is unpredictable, with fog common even in warmer months. The combination of cold water and air creates dangerous conditions for sailors.

## Resources
- **Fish**: Abundant and valuable fish populations that support coastal communities
- **Island Defense**: Natural protection that makes the islands difficult to attack by [[Mar]] raiders
