## Short Description
The central mountain range between [Mosswater](Mosswater.md) and the [Elven Reach](Elven%20Reach.md), with deep valleys cutting through its rocky heights.

## Cultures
- **[Hiren](../../factions/Hiren.md) Clans**: Dwarves and gnomes who maintain strong stone defense structures throughout the mountains
- **Mountain Herders**: Small groups who tend hardy livestock in the high valleys
- **Prospectors**: Those who search the mountains for valuable minerals and ancient artifacts

## Cities and Sites
- **[Stonegate](../sites/Stonegate.md)(../../sites/Stonegate.md)**: Principal Hiren fortress, an impregnable mountain stronghold with underground trade routes
- **The Deep Valleys**: Fertile mountain valleys where communities thrive, protected by the surrounding peaks
- **Ancient Watchtowers**: Ruined Aryn structures that still stand guard over key mountain passes
- **[The Forge Caves](../sites/The%20Forge%20Caves.md)(../../sites/The Forge Caves.md)**: Where Hiren smiths create their renowned steel products, using techniques kept secret from outsiders

## Climate
Harsh and variable, with snow covering the highest peaks year-round. Deep valleys experience more moderate conditions, with warm summers supporting limited agriculture. Spring brings dangerous meltwater floods, while autumn sees early frosts in the high elevations. The mountains create their own weather patterns, with rain shadows affecting both sides.

## Resources
- **Iron Ore**: Rich deposits that form the backbone of Hiren metalworking
- **Stone**: Abundant high-quality stone for construction and defense
- **Mountain Springs**: Fresh water sources that feed rivers flowing to both [Mosswater](Mosswater.md) and the [Elven Reach](Elven%20Reach.md)
- **Rare Minerals**: Valuable deposits used in specialized crafting and trade
- **Strategic Position**: Control over mountain passes that facilitate or restrict trade between regions
