# Ironfen

## Short Description
The wetlands around the north edges of Mosswater, where ironburners burn peat for iron production and practice charcoal-making from the abundant trees. Rainfall on the Ironcrest range brings iron into the marshes. 

## Cultures
- **[[Ironburners]] Communities**: The primary inhabitants who operate peat fires and charcoal pits, supporting the ironworking industry
- **Peat Harvesters**: Specialized workers who gather and process peat from the wetlands
- **Woodcutters**: Those who selectively harvest trees for charcoal production, maintaining forest sustainability

## Cities and Sites
- **[[Charhill]](../../sites/Charhill.md)**: Merged [[Ironburners]] settlement combining former Peatworks operations into a massive industrial center
- **[[The Smoke Pits]](../../sites/The Smoke Pits.md)**: Area where ironburners maintain their forge operations, constantly shrouded in smoke
- **[[Wetwood Forest]](../../sites/Wetwood Forest.md)**: Carefully managed woodland where specific trees are harvested for charcoal

## Climate
Damp and cool year-round, with frequent fog rising from the wetlands and Mosswater. The air is thick with the smell of burning peat and charcoal. Summers are mild with persistent dampness, while winters bring freezing temperatures that make ironworking particularly challenging. The wet environment ensures constant moisture but also makes fuel preservation difficult.

## Resources
- **Peat**: Abundant wetland resource that serve as a source of iron
- **Wood**: Forests providing timber for charcoal making, the other essential fuel for ironworking
- **Iron Ore**: Small deposits
- **Charcoal**: The processed fuel product that supports regional trade and local industry
- **Strategic Location**: Control over fuel production that supports the broader [[Ironburners]] economy
- **Fresh Water**: Access to clean water from Mosswater and numerous wetland streams
