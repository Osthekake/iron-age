## Short Description
The southern desert where ghosts of ancient seafarers dwell in scattered stone structures, marking the southern extent of [[Merona]].

## Cultures
- **[[Aegon]] Remnants**: Ancient water-themed undead spirits that haunt the stone forts
- **Scavengers**: Small groups of desperate survivors who brave the supernatural dangers for rare resources

## Cities and Sites
- **Sunken Forts**: Ancient stone structures half-buried in sand, where [[Aegon]] ghosts are most active
- **Oasis of Last Hope**: A rare water source that attracts both the living and dead
- **The Bone Coast**: Where ancient ships are preserved in the dry desert air, their spectral crews still walking the decks

- **Preserved Materials**: Exceptionally well-preserved wood and metal from ancient structures
- **Salt Deposits**: Valuable mineral deposits from dried seabeds
