# Whisperwood

## Short Description
The dark forests at the eastern shores of Mosswater, where the wood-dwelling halfling Paer thrive in deep woods.

## Cultures
- **[[Paer]] Halflings**: Wood-dwelling halflings who live in harmony with the forest and maintain its protection
- **Forest Keepers**: Those who guard ancient groves and maintain the balance between nature and settlement
- **Swamp Dwellers**: Communities that live in the wetter areas where forest meets Mosswater's shores

## Cities and Sites

- **Sacred Groves**: Ancient forest sites where the Paer perform their ceremonies and maintain connection to the woods
- **The Whispering Paths**: Hidden forest trails known only to the Paer, allowing safe travel through the dense woods
- **Riverside Hamlets**: Small settlements where the forest meets the shores of Mosswater

## Climate
Damp and shaded year-round, with the dense canopy blocking much direct sunlight. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Rain is frequent, creating perpetually moist conditions. Winters are mild but very damp, while summers bring humidity and the constant sound of insects among the trees.
