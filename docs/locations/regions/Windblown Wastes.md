## Short Description
Grassy plains in wide valleys without a single tree, home to invading Mar forces and constant danger.

## Cultures
- **[[Mar]] Raiders**: Giants and hobgoblins who invaded from the east, living as pirates and bandits
- **Nomadic Survivors**: Small groups of original inhabitants who live on the move, avoiding Mar forces
- **Borderland Defenders**: Those who attempt to protect the western edges from Mar expansion

## Cities and Sites
- **Mar Strongholds**: Captured Aryn and Rhuul forts that serve as bases for raiding operations
- **The Empty Crossroads**: Where ancient roads meet, now dangerous gathering places for Mar bands
- **Hidden Valleys**: Small, protected areas where survivors attempt to maintain some semblance of normal life
- **Old Ruins**: Remnants of Aryn civilization that Mar forces use as shelter and defensive positions

## Climate
Exposed and windy year-round, with no natural protection from the elements. Summers are hot and dry, with occasional rain, resulting in small streams everywhere. Winters are brutally cold, with winds that can freeze exposed flesh in minutes. The lack of trees means there's no shelter from the weather, making travel extremely dangerous in the winter time.

## Resources
- **Ancient Artifacts**: Remnants of Aryn and Rhuul technology that Mar forces scavenge
- **Grazing Land**: Limited areas where hardy livestock can be maintained by those who know the secrets
- **Strategic Position**: Control over the eastern approaches to the rest of [[Merona]]
- **Raiding Targets**: Proximity to wealthier regions that makes it an ideal base for Mar operations
- **Hidden Resources**: Unknown deposits or materials that may exist beneath the seemingly empty plains
