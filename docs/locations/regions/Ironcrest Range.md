## Short Description
The long mountain chain that separates [Mosswater](Mosswater.md) from [Frostmere](Frostmere.md), rich in rainfall, iron, and vast stretches of bogs and moors.

## Cultures
- **[Northherders](../../factions/Northherders.md) Clans**: Nomadic fishermen and animal herders who practice shamanistic blood religion
- **[Ironburners](../../factions/Ironburners.md) Outposts**: Small camps and towns that process iron from the mountains
- **Bog Dwellers**: Reclusive communities that live in the moors and bogs, maintaining ancient traditions

## Cities and Sites
- **Bloodstone Circle**: Sacred Northherder site where shamanistic rituals are performed
- **Ironfall Forge**: Main Ironburner settlement where iron from the mountains is processed
- **The Whispering Bogs**: Vast marshlands where supernatural phenomena are common, especially during darkness
- **Glacier's End**: Where mountain glaciers feed the rivers that flow toward [Mosswater](Mosswater.md)

## Climate
Extremely wet with heavy rainfall throughout the year, creating the bogs and moors that characterize the eastern slopes. Summers are cool and damp, while winters bring deep snow to the peaks and freezing rain to the lower elevations. The constant moisture contributes to the iron deposits and creates dangerous conditions for travel.

## Resources
- **Iron Ore**: Rich deposits that are the primary source of metal for the Ironburners
- **Peat**: Harvested from the bogs for fuel, especially valuable in the cold climate
- **Hardy Livestock**: Animals adapted to the harsh mountain conditions that the Northherders herd
- **Fresh Water**: Abundant clean water from mountain springs and rivers
- **Medicinal Herbs**: Plants that grow in the bog environments, used in Northherder shamanistic practices
- **Strategic Position**: Control over mountain passes that connect different regions
