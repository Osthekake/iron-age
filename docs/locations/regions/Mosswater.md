## Short Description
A large teal-green inland lake separated from [Frostmere](Frostmere.md) by the [Ironcrest Range](Ironcrest%20Range.md), connected to the [Elven Reach](Elven%20Reach.md) via rivers and lakes.

## Cultures
- **[Ironburners](../../factions/Ironburners.md) charcoal fields** Where iron burners make their charcoal
- **Fishing Communities**: Small settlements that depend on the lake's bounty for survival
- **River Traders**: People who navigate the connecting waterways between [Mosswater](Mosswater.md) and the [Elven Reach](Elven%20Reach.md)

## Cities and Sites
- **The Teal Shores**: Fishing villages known for their distinctive boat designs and fishing techniques
- **Rivermouth Forts**: Defensive structures at points where rivers connect to other waterways
- **[The Deep Channels](../sites/The%20Deep%20Channels.md)(../../sites/The Deep Channels.md)**: Areas of the lake where strange creatures are said to dwell, reflecting the magical nature of darkness

## Climate
Mild and damp around the shores, with frequent fog that rolls off the teal waters. The water itself remains cool year-round, creating microclimates along the coastline. Rain is common, particularly in the spring and autumn, contributing to the lake's greenish color from algae and mineral content.

## Resources
- **Fish**: Abundant and varied fish populations, the primary food source for coastal communities
- **Fresh Water**: Clean, drinkable water that supports both settlements and agriculture in surrounding areas
- **Transport Routes**: Natural waterways that facilitate trade between regions
- **Mystical Properties**: Areas where the water's connection to ancient magic is still strong, particularly during twilight hours
