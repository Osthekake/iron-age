## Description
The principal Hiren fortress and mountain stronghold, built into the living rock of the Spine Peaks. This massive defensive complex serves as both military bastion and industrial center, housing the renowned Hiren forges and protecting their steel-making secrets. The fortress controls key mountain passes and houses the underground trade routes that connect different regions. Its strategic position makes it nearly impossible to besiege, while the forge caves produce some of the finest steel in Merona.
