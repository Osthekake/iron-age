## Description
Small halfling communities built into the very landscape they protect, with homes integrated into hillsides and under the root systems of ancient trees. These settlements are nearly invisible to outsiders, known only to those who understand the forest's secrets. The [Paer](../../factions/Paer.md) maintain perfect harmony with their woodland environment, harvesting only what is needed and protecting the forest's balance. Their homes feature natural camouflage, specialized construction techniques that preserve tree health, and sophisticated ventilation systems that prevent smoke from giving away their positions.
