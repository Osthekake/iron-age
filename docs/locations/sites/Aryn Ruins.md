## Description
Extensive stone ruins scattered throughout Elvenshade forests, representing remnants of the once-great Aryn Civilization. These ruins contain remnants of advanced technology and magical knowledge, now slowly being reclaimed by the forest. The sites feature impressive stonework that modern craftsmen cannot replicate, mysterious mechanisms that still function intermittently, and extensive underground complexes that hint at the true scope of ancient elven achievements. Cerwin researchers carefully study these locations to recover lost knowledge, while elven remnants protect the sites from excessive exploitation.
