## Description
Ancient paved elven roads now largely consumed by forest growth, representing the fading remnants of once-great [[Aryn Civilization]] transportation network. These roads occasionally emerge from the undergrowth, showing the advanced engineering capabilities of ancient [[Aryn Civilization]]. The Overgrown Way serves as both a reminder of past glory and a practical, though hazardous, transportation route through dense forests. Forest creatures have adapted to these corridors, while [[Mar]] raiders use them for ambushes, and [[Paer]] guides know the safe passages.
