## Description
Ancient paved elven roads now largely consumed by forest growth, representing the fading remnants of once-great [Aryn Civilization](../../factions/Aryn Civilization.md) transportation network. These roads occasionally emerge from the undergrowth, showing the advanced engineering capabilities of ancient [Aryn Civilization](../../factions/Aryn Civilization.md). The Overgrown Way serves as both a reminder of past glory and a practical, though hazardous, transportation route through dense forests. Forest creatures have adapted to these corridors, while [Mar](../../factions/Mar.md) raiders use them for ambushes, and [Paer](../../factions/Paer.md) guides know the safe passages.
