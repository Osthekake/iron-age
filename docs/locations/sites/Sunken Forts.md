## Region
[Aegon Wastes](../regions/Aegon%20Wastes.md)
## Architecture
Ancient stone structures half-buried in desert sand, featuring corroded metal fittings and weather-worn masonry. The forts show advanced Aegon construction techniques with water-resistant materials and defensive designs. Many structures are partially submerged, with ghostly crews still walking their decks.

## Description
Scattered ancient [Aegon](../../factions/Aegon.md) military installations now serving as haunting grounds for water-themed undead spirits. These stone forts represent the remnants of a once-powerful seafaring civilization that dominated the southern seas. The structures appear to emerge and sink with desert winds, creating supernatural phenomena where spectral crews continue their eternal duty. The site draws both desperate scavengers seeking ancient artifacts and curious [Cerwin elves](../../factions/Cerwin%20elves.md) researchers studying lost technology, while the [Aegon](../../factions/Aegon.md) ghosts remain bound to their posts through ancient curses and oaths.
