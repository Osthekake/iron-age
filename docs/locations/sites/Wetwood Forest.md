## Description
Carefully managed woodland where specific trees are harvested for charcoal production while maintaining forest sustainability. This area represents the [Ironburners](../../factions/Ironburners.md)' balance between industrial needs and environmental stewardship. The Wetwood Forest features systematic harvesting cycles that ensure the forest remains healthy for future generations, while providing the specialized timber needed for high-quality charcoal production. [Ironburners](../../factions/Ironburners.md) working here follow strict guidelines to prevent over-harvesting and maintain the forest's role in the broader Ironfen ecosystem.
