## Description
Where ancient ships are preserved in the dry desert air, their spectral crews still walking the decks in eternal patrols. This remarkable coastline serves as both an archaeological treasure and a haunting supernatural phenomenon. The Bone Coast contains vessels from [[Aegon]]'s seafaring civilization, now functioning as eternal ghost ships with spectral crews continuing their ancient duties. The site draws Cerwin researchers seeking to understand ancient technology, while the spectral [[Aegon]] remain bound to their vessels through supernatural curses and ancient oaths.
