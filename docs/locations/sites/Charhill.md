## Description
The merged [[Ironburners]] settlement that combines the industrial might of Charhill and Peatworks into a single, massive production center. This unified complex serves as the primary hub for peat harvesting and charcoal processing throughout Ironfen, with smoke visible for miles across the wetlands. The settlement features the largest concentration of [[Ironburners]] in the region, with extensive workshops, storage facilities, and trade networks that supply ironworking communities across northern Merona. The combined facility represents the pinnacle of [[Ironburners]] industrial capability in the wetlands.
