## Description
Small settlements where the Whisperwood forest meets the shores of Mosswater, representing the interface between the Paer's woodland domain and the broader world. These communities specialize in fishing, boat building, and managing the transition between forest culture and lake trade. The hamlets serve as trading posts where forest products are exchanged for goods from other regions, while maintaining the Paer's protective relationship with their woodland home.
