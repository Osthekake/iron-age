## Description
The only reliable water source in the vast [Aegon Wastes](../regions/Aegon Wastes.md), attracting both the living and the dead who seek the precious resource. This natural oasis supports life in an otherwise inhospitable desert, with ancient stone structures providing shelter and archaeological interest. The oasis serves as a critical stopping point for desert travel, a gathering place for supernatural beings, and a site where desperate survivors risk encounters with [Aegon](../../factions/Aegon.md) ghosts for access to water and ancient knowledge.
