## Description
Ancient forest sites where the [Paer](../../factions/Paer.md) perform their ceremonies and maintain connection to the woods. These sacred clearings are centers of spiritual power where ancient practices are preserved and passed down through generations. The groves feature particularly old and large trees, stone arrangements for rituals, and natural spaces designed to honor the forest's spirits. The Paer elders use these locations to teach younger generations about forest wisdom, conduct important ceremonies, and maintain their people's deep connection to the natural world.
