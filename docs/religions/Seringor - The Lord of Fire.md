## Description
Seringor, the Lord of Fire, is the deity revered by [Cerwin elves](../factions/Cerwin elves.md) and [Westmen](../factions/Westmen.md) as the keeper of knowledge and driver of progress. This dragon-like god embodies both the destructive and creative aspects of fire - the ash that brings renewal and the flame that forges new possibilities. Seringor is worshipped as the source of enlightenment, teaching his followers to master fire not just for warmth and protection, but as a tool for advancement and understanding. [Cerwin elves](../factions/Cerwin elves.md) see him as a cosmic dragon whose ancient wisdom fuels their pursuit of knowledge, while [Westmen](../factions/Westmen.md) view him as the divine smith who shapes the world and teaches them to shape their own destiny. Some [Hiren](../factions/Hiren.md) craftspeople also follow Seringor, drawn to his domain over the transformative power of fire in metalworking. Worship emphasizes the responsible use of knowledge, the constant pursuit of improvement, and the understanding that destruction often precedes creation.
