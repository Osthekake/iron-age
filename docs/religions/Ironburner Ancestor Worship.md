## Description
Ironburner Ancestor Worship is a secret faith practiced away from prying eyes and official scrutiny. Its adherents believe they descend from [the barrow men](../factions/The%20Barrow%20Men.md) - ancient dead who still possess wisdom and power to aid their living descendants. Practitioners "visit" these ancestors by passing through special stone archways that serve as portals to the realm of the dead. Through these journeys, they seek advice on metallurgy, survival, and protection from supernatural threats. The religion emphasizes cooperation between living and dead Ironburners, working together to hold back encroaching darkness that threatens their people. This faith preserves ancient knowledge and traditions that might otherwise be lost, maintaining a connection to the strength and resilience of their forebears.
