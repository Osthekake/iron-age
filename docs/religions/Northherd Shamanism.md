## Description
Northherd Shamanism is a harsh, pragmatic faith centered on survival in the unforgiving northern lands. Practitioners believe the spirit world is as dangerous and unforgiving as the physical realm, requiring constant appeasement and strength. The religion is built around blood sacrifices of herd animals to feed hungry spirits, dark journeys where shamans deprive themselves of light and comfort to gain wisdom, and constant prayer for protection from the elements, predator spirits, and the encroaching darkness. Shamans serve as intermediaries between their people and the countless spirits that inhabit the tundra, using their ability to traverse the spirit realm to negotiate for better hunts, larger herds, and safe passage through treacherous lands.
