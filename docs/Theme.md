### Technology
Writing is rare. Metalworking is a known technology, but the metals themselves are expensive. Most uses where wood or stone will do the job, will still use those rather than metal. 
Leather and fabrics are common. Houses are made without metal nails. Metal hinges and hooks would be more normal to see.
Swords, helmets, chainmail and so on are very expensive items.
